# Long time no see
*The only feature from Facebook that I ever needed.*

## What this does.
This script stores contact names in a db, with the last time you talked to them. 

So, you add a list of contacts that you haven't talked in a long time and want to keep in touch.

So, after this you can: 

* Get a random contact from the db. 
* Get the contact that you haven't talked for a longest time. 

Of course, you can update the data, so when you've talked to someone you just need to update the 
contact and that's it. 

## Under the hood. 
This is an extremely simple python3 script that stores contacts and dates into a sqlite db.
